# ESP32---PCB-Design
PCB design project demonstrating schematic capture, 2-layer PCB layout, and design rule validation using Altium.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the design files and documentation for a **PCB design project**.  
The project focuses on applying **core PCB design principles**, including schematic capture, component placement, routing, and design rule checks for a functional electronic circuit.

The objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience in **professional PCB design workflows** used in hardware and embedded systems development.
